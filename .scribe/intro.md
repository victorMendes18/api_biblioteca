# Introduction

The API offers a complete service for managing library book loans. It allows the registration of two types of users: administrators (ADM) and librarians (librarian), who will have access to the API's functionalities. In addition, it is possible to manage the library's collection, register students and control loans made by them.

This documentation aims to provide all the information you need to work with our API.

<aside>As you scroll, you'll see code examples for working with the API in different programming languages in the dark area to the right (or as part of the content on mobile).
You can switch the language used with the tabs at the top right (or from the nav menu at the top left on mobile).</aside>
